I couldn't find a one-use tool for running encounters in my campaigns, and was honestly getting tired of alternating between browsers and books. So I decided to make my own!
The repository is maintained in my sparetime, and only tested on windows 10, using python 3. Anyone is welcome to use it, and hopefully I will have made the life easier for some dungeon masters out there :)
