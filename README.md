I couldn't find a one-use tool for running encounters in my campaigns, and was honestly getting tired of alternating between browsers and books. So I decided to make my own!
The repository is maintained in my sparetime, and only tested on windows 10, using python 3. Anyone is welcome to use it, and hopefully I will have made the life easier for some dungeon masters out there :)

The project only works on windows ATM, but cross-OS compability is planned for the future.

Installation:
There are two ways to run RainyDM, either by cloning the repository or running the standalone. If you want to try out any of the features in development, you'd need to go the repository route. The standalone is intended to by friendly to non-git and non-python oriented people. Note that the project is written in python 3.

Standalone:
1. Download the standalone from the releases page.
2. Unpack to a folder of your choice.
3. Run the shortcut or navigate to RainyDM.exe.
4. Goal!

Repository:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the repository folder where RainyDM.py is located.
3. Type "pip install -r requirements.txt".
4. Type "python RainyDM.py" or "python3 RainyDM.py".
5. Goal!
