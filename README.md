I couldn't find a one-use tool for running encounters in my campaigns, and was honestly getting tired of alternating between browsers and books. So I decided to make my own!
The repository is maintained in my sparetime, and only tested on windows 10, using python 3. Anyone is welcome to use it, and hopefully I will have made the life easier for some dungeon masters out there :)

I made a stand-alone windows executable for those of you that don't feel familiar with python - http://www.mediafire.com/file/pavmng9v4dm8bmw/RainyDM.zip
For some reason though, the pictures and graphics turned out weird... It works, but I still recommend installing python 3 and running the code from the repo.
